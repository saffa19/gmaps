### gmapstest

Testing out the extent of integration that Google Maps has with Flutter.

### notes
not great

### TODO
- combine directions API with the standard android maps SDK
- will need to use http for requests
- could remove the need for maps sdk in the first place, we'll see

### before using this
I've not included the AndroidManifest.xml file in android>app>srccc>main because it has my api key in it.

Can't be bothered putting it in a different file for now
